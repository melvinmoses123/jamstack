# 4 - Generating the site from a content API

This repo holds one of a series of examples of JAMstack sites from a freeCodeCamp video. The video, "Introduction to JAMstack" is available to view for free on freeCodeCamp.

## About this example

The 4th of our 6 code examples, this example builds on [example 3](https://findthat.at/jamstack/ex3) to generate content in the site with the use of a [static site generator](https://staticgen.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=fcc-examples-pnh&utm_campaign=devex) first pulling content from a content API at build time.

Here in the video, we begin to source news content from the [News API](https://newsapi.org/) feed, and use this in our generated site.

## Local development

To work on this example locally, you can clone the repository and start editing, although there are a few pre-requisites:

- [NodeJS and NPM](https://nodejs.org/)
- A free [Netlify account](https://www.netlify.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=fcc-examples-pnh&utm_campaign=devex)
- A free [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/) API key

```bash

# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/philhawksworth/fcc-4-build-with-api-data

# move into the working directory and install dependencies
cd fcc-4-build-with-api-data
npm install

# build and start the local development server
npm start

# just run the build
npm run build

```
